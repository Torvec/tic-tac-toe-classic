### Notes

- This project originally started in my other repository [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Torvec/tic-tac-toe) that I decided to split into two separate projects. The other is the Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game which can be found here: [Ultimate Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/Torvec/tic-tac-toe-ultimate)
